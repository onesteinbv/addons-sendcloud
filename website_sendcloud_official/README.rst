Usage
=====

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

In short this is how the module works:
 - the customer selects some products in the online shop. The products are added in the shopping Cart
 - then the customer opens his shopping Cart and clicks on Process Checkout
 - the customer chooses one of the delivery method that Sendcloud provides


Service Point Picker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The module contains a link that opens the Service Point Picker (javascript) in the website shopping Cart.
The link is placed near the selected Sendcloud Shipping Method. The link is visible in case:

 - the configuration in the Sendcloud panel has the Service Point flag to True (in the Sendcloud integration config)
 - the Shipping Method selected in the picking is provided by Sendcloud
 - the Shipping Method has field sendcloud_service_point_input == "required"
 - all the criteria (from country, to country, weight) match with the current order
 - the Shipping Method is set to "Published" in the website
